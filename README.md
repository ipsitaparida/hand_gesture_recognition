# hand_gesture_recognition
Hand gesture recognition using surface EMG signals. 

# Models 
SVM, CNN

# Result
Individualized CNN models provided better result indicating unique muscle activation patterns specific to each person's hand gestures. This approach mitigates the impact of inter-subject variability and leads to enhanced recognition performance tailored to the individual
